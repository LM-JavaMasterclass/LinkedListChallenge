         Challenge: LinkedList

         Create a program that implements a playlist for songs
         Create a Song class having Title and Duration for a song.
         The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs.
         The albums will be stored in an ArrayList
         Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order
         they are added.
         Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:-
         Quit,Skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to a previous song.  Replay the current song.
         List the songs in the playlist
         A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that
         you own).
         Hint:  To replay a song, consider what happened when we went back and forth from a city before we
         started tracking the direction we were going.
